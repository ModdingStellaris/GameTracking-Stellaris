###################
# Balance
###################

* Titans now have access to the Carrier combat computer (so they can stay back with a carrier based fleet instead of closing to Artillery range).
* "Interpretation Signal" anomaly event now also offers a reward in society research.
* Removed Empire cohesion from the game.

* The Galatron now increases Diplomatic Weight by +100%.
* Envoys are sent home when their origin country enters war against their host country.
* Empires may now forcefully resettle pops off of doomed planets regardless of their resettlement policy. The egalitarian faction has been paid off and will ignore this trampling of the rights to explode on your own terms.
* Repeatable technologies now provide full points towards victory score and diplomatic weight.
* Increased the effect technology has on diplomatic weight.
* Reduced the effect fleet power has on diplomatic weight.
* Denouncement resolutions can now only be proposed against rivals or empires you have poor relations with.
* Empires are more likely to abstain from resolutions in the Galactic Community.
* Increased the effect opinion of the proposer (or target, for targeted resolutions) has on willingness of AIs to support or oppose resolutions.
